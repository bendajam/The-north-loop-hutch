# The north loop hutch

Over the last few weeks I’ve been spending my nights working on a new hutch for the living room. I’ve spent a good amount of time looking at different designs at restores and midcentury specific resellers. My house is from the 1950’s and thought it made sense to make piece of furniture that fit well within the era of the house. 

### Planning
After starting messing around with wood working the last year or so, I’ve realized the importance of planning. A simple sketch of what you are trying to do can save tons of time playing with the design while building. If you do end up changing the design during the build and you have plans it’s a change from what you know so it’s a lot easier to quickly make the modifications.
Here is the mockup of the design using SketchUp. 

After that was done and I had to decide on the material. I decided on natural maple. I love darker colors, but I wanted to build a piece that lightens the space and since it’s already fairly dark in my house going for a lighter tone made sense. 

### Progress
After that I packed all the rough boards in the car and drove off to prepare the panels at a friend’s shop since I don’t own a jointer or planer. 

The picture I’m jointing out the twist of the boards. 

Now I’ve gotten all of the boards glued up and ready to assemble at home. 


To put the box together I used a great simple dowelit tool to put everything together.

### Result

Really happy with how this all turned out. If I made another one I know what I would do differently. Not really in design specs, but on how to put it all together to save time and headache. 


I had considered making a back-brass rail for the books to be pushed against, so they don’t fall behind the hutch. I may make another post about bending brass and using a tap and die to create threaded metal parts if I do end up making it.
